# Presence

The webserver needs some sort of presence feature where the frontend can set certain "presence markers" which can then be queried by the actors. This will allow actors to decide if they should stream results or just generate them at once. And mayabe also decide how much time to spend on producing an answer.

This could just be implemented as a wit query to the the root actor or some website actor proxy.
