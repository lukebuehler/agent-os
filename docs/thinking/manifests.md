## How to know what a wit needs to run?

We need a way to indicate to the runtime or worker what the wit/actor needs to run.

## Indicators
 - Language or language runtime
 - Library versions (sem versioned)

I think that's it.

## Structure

Where to save this information? We could re-use the wit structure for this. But probably should be a separate file.
